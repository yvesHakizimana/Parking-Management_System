the car if it can enter twice without coming out
if the system can pay twice for going out
the car can exit without going in
Verify also if the balance can't be negative


unauthorized exit alert subsystem
in the gate we have
sensor trigger connected to pin 2
sensor echo connected to pin 3
red led -- 4
blue led -- 5
servor motor -- 6
hardcorded ground -- 7
hardcorder ground -- 8
buzzer - 12

by default gate is closed and when the arduino is connected to the computer red led is red and the buzzer also has some noise at the startup like few seconds

when the gate is opened the blue led truns blue and wait for 15 seconds to close the gate and after and like buzzer has some less noise when exiting

so what I have to add is being able to handle when someone wants like to go oiut without payment it will be triggered and must be handled as

well like

i want to you generate the corresponding to gate and also update exit and entry accordingly
